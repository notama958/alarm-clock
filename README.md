## Alarm GUI
### Notice
1. when running in web should be open in inspect mode
    - reason: event click will mess up if not in inspect mode (except for fast increment/decrement button)
2. when using fast increment/decrement button, don't use inspect mode
    - reason: it cannot capture the mouse event

### Limitations
- merely work and contain bugs :) so tired of this project
